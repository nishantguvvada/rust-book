# CHAPTER 1

## The `main` Function

- The `main` function is **special**: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
- `println!` calls a **Rust macro** (macros generate code to extend Rust syntax).
- The `!` symbol means you are calling a **macro** instead of a normal function.

## Compiling vs Running

- **Compiling and running are separate steps.**
- Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler:
  ```bash
  rustc main.rs
  ```
- Rust outputs a **binary executable**, along with other files:

  - `main.rs` → Source code file
  - `main.exe` → Executable file (on Windows)
  - `main` → Executable file (on Linux/macOS)
  - `main.pdb` → Debugging information file (on Windows)

- Rust is an **ahead-of-time compiled language**.
  - You can compile a program once and give the executable to someone else and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

## Cargo

- Rust’s **build system and package manager**.
- Cargo handles:

  - Building code
  - Downloading libraries
  - Building dependencies (in Rust, libraries = dependencies)

- To create a new project:

  ```bash
  cargo new hello_cargo
  ```

- Cargo generates:

  - `Cargo.toml` file
  - `src` directory with `main.rs` file

- **TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language)** example:

  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "hello_cargo"
  version = "0.1.0"
  edition = "2024"

  [dependencies]
  ```

- In Rust, packages of code are called **crates**.

---

## Building and Running a Cargo Project

- To build the project:

  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```

  - Creates an executable in `target/debug/main.exe` (Windows) or `target/debug/main` (Linux/macOS).
  - The default build is a **debug build**.

- Running `cargo build` for the first time also generates:

  - `Cargo.lock` → Tracks exact versions of dependencies.

- To check code quickly without producing an executable:
  ```bash
  cargo check
  ```

---

## Summary

- Create a project → `cargo new`
- Build a project → `cargo build`
- Build & run a project → `cargo run`
- Check for errors without building → `cargo check`
- Cargo stores build outputs in `target/debug` instead of the source directory.
